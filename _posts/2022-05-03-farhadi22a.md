title: " Differentially Private Densest Subgraph "
abstract: " Given a graph, the densest subgraph problem asks for a set of vertices
  such that the average degree among these vertices is maximized. Densest subgraph
  has numerous applications in learning, e.g., community detection in social networks,
  link spam detection, correlation mining, bioinformatics, and so on. Although there
  are efficient algorithms that output either exact or approximate solutions to the
  densest subgraph problem, existing algorithms may violate the privacy of the individuals
  in the network, e.g., leaking the existence/non-existence of edges. In this paper,
  we study the densest subgraph problem in the framework of the differential privacy,
  and we derive the upper and lower bounds for this problem. We show that there exists
  a linear-time $\\epsilon$-differentially private algorithm that finds a 2-approximation
  of the densest subgraph with an extra poly-logarithmic additive error. Our algorithm
  not only reports the approximate density of the densest subgraph, but also reports
  the vertices that form the dense subgraph. Our upper bound almost matches the famous
  2-approximation by Charikar both in performance and in approximation ratio, but
  we additionally achieve differential privacy. In comparison with Charikarâ€™s algorithm,
  our algorithm has an extra poly logarithmic additive error. We partly justify the
  additive error with a new lower bound, showing that for any differentially private
  algorithm that provides a constant-factor approximation, a sub-logarithmic additive
  error is inherent. We also practically study our differentially private algorithm
  on real-world graphs, and we show that in practice the algorithm finds a solution
  which is very close to the optimal. "
