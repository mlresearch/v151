title: " k-experts - Online Policies and Fundamental Limits "
abstract: " We introduce the k-experts problem - a generalization of the classic Prediction
  with Expertâ€™s Advice framework. Unlike the classic version, where the learner selects
  exactly one expert from a pool of N experts at each round, in this problem, the
  learner selects a subset of k experts at each round (1<= k <= N). The reward obtained
  by the learner at each round is assumed to be a function of the k selected experts.
  The primary objective is to design an online learning policy with a small regret.
  In this pursuit, we propose SAGE (Sampled Hedge) - a framework for designing efficient
  online learning policies by leveraging statistical sampling techniques. For a wide
  class of reward functions, we show that SAGE either achieves the first sublinear
  regret guarantee or improves upon the existing ones. Furthermore, going beyond the
  notion of regret, we fully characterize the mistake bounds achievable by online
  learning policies for stable loss functions. We conclude the paper by establishing
  a tight regret lower bound for a variant of the k-experts problem and carrying out
  experiments with standard datasets. "
