title: " SAN: Stochastic Average Newton Algorithm for Minimizing Finite Sums "
abstract: " We present a principled approach for designing stochastic Newton methods
  for solving finite sum optimization problems. Our approach has two steps. First,
  we re-write the stationarity conditions as a system of nonlinear equations that
  associates each data point to a new row. Second, we apply a Subsampled Newton Raphson
  method to solve this system of nonlinear equations. Using our approach, we develop
  a new Stochastic Average Newton (SAN) method, which is incremental by design, in
  that it requires only a single data point per iteration. It is also cheap to implement
  when solving regularized generalized linear models, with a cost per iteration of
  the order of the number of the parameters. We show through extensive numerical experiments
  that SAN requires no knowledge about the problem, neither parameter tuning, while
  remaining competitive as compared to classical variance reduced gradient methods
  (e.g. SAG and SVRG), incremental Newton and quasi-Newton methods (e.g. SNM, IQN). "
