title: " Diversity and Generalization in Neural Network Ensembles "
abstract: " Ensembles are widely used in machine learning and, usually, provide state-of-the-art
  performance in many prediction tasks. From the very beginning, the diversity of
  an ensemble has been identified as a key factor for the superior performance of
  these models. But the exact role that diversity plays in ensemble models is poorly
  understood, specially in the context of neural networks. In this work, we combine
  and expand previously published results in a theoretically sound framework that
  describes the relationship between diversity and ensemble performance for a wide
  range of ensemble methods. More precisely, we provide sound answers to the following
  questions: how to measure diversity, how diversity relates to the generalization
  error of an ensemble, and how diversity is promoted by neural network ensemble algorithms.
  This analysis covers three widely used loss functions, namely, the squared loss,
  the cross-entropy loss, and the 0-1 loss; and two widely used model combination
  strategies, namely, model averaging and weighted majority vote. We empirically validate
  this theoretical analysis with neural network ensembles. "
