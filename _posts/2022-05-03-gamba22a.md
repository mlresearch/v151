title: " Are All Linear Regions Created Equal? "
abstract: " The number of linear regions has been studied as a proxy of complexity
  for ReLU networks. However, the empirical success of network compression techniques
  like pruning and knowledge distillation, suggest that in the overparameterized setting,
  linear regions density might fail to capture the effective nonlinearity. In this
  work, we propose an efficient algorithm for discovering linear regions and use it
  to investigate the effectiveness of density in capturing the nonlinearity of trained
  VGGs and ResNets on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. We contrast the results with a more
  principled nonlinearity measure based on function variation, highlighting the shortcomings
  of linear regions density. Furthermore, interestingly, our measure of nonlinearity
  clearly correlates with model-wise deep double descent, connecting reduced test
  error with reduced nonlinearity, and increased local similarity of linear regions. "
